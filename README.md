# Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO)

## Introduction

This Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO) is designed to model the various elements involved in managing supply chains within an organization. It represents different entities such as suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, products, and their interrelations. This structured approach helps in optimizing, monitoring, and managing supply chains systematically.

## Classes and Subclasses

The ontology consists of numerous classes and subclasses, organized hierarchically into key areas relevant to supply chain management:

### Top-Level Ontology (BFO) Concepts

- Continuant
  - MaterialEntity
    - Organization
      - Supplier
      - Customer
    - Person
    - Agent
  - ObjectAggregate
    - SupplyChain
    - Factory
    - ManufacturingResource
      - PieceOfEquipment
        - MachiningEquipment
  - SpecificallyDependentContinuant
    - Role
      - SupplierRole
      - CustomerRole
      - SupplyChainMemberRole
        - MaterialProviderRole
        - ComponentProviderRole
        - ServiceProviderRole
          - MachiningServiceProviderRole
          - CastingServiceProviderRole
          - TransportationServiceProviderRole
          - TestingServiceProviderRole
    - Capability
      - ManufacturingCapability
      - ProductionCapability
      - OrganizationalCapability
      - SurfaceRoughnessCapability
      - MaterialCapability
      - ProcessCapability
    - Function
      - MachiningFunction

### Mid-Level Ontologies (CCO) Concepts

- GroupOfOrganizations
- Agent
- Organization
- Person

### SCRO Specific Concepts

- SupplyChainMaterialEntities
- PieceOfEquipment
  - MachiningEquipment

### Network Representation of Supply Chains

- ActOfShipment
- ActOfCommunication
- InformationEntity

### Other Relevant Concepts

- EngineeredSystem
- Artifact
  - Component
  - MachineEquipment
    - ManufacturingMachine
- SupplyChainSystem

## Object Properties

Object properties define relationships between classes:

- hasRole (domain: Agent, range: Role)
- participatesIn (domain: MaterialEntity, range: Occurrent)
- hasCapability (domain: MaterialEntity, range: Capability)
- hasPart (domain: ObjectAggregate, range: MaterialEntity)
- sends (domain: Agent, range: ActOfCommunication)
- receives (domain: Agent, range: ActOfCommunication)

## Data Properties

Data properties define attributes of individuals:

- hasSurfaceRoughness (domain: MachiningEquipment, range: xsd:float)
- hasMaterialType (domain: MachiningEquipment, range: xsd:string)
- hasProcessType (domain: MachiningEquipment, range: xsd:string)
- hasProductionCapacity (domain: Factory, range: xsd:integer)

## Disjoint Classes

- Supplier is disjoint with Customer
- SupplierRole is disjoint with CustomerRole
- MachiningServiceProviderRole is disjoint with:
  - CastingServiceProviderRole
  - TransportationServiceProviderRole
  - TestingServiceProviderRole

## Example Individuals

Example individuals demonstrate the ontology's use:

- Supplier1 (type: Supplier, hasRole: SupplierRole)
- Customer1 (type: Customer, hasRole: CustomerRole)
- Factory1 (type: Factory, hasProductionCapacity: 1000, hasPart: Machine1, hasPart: Machine2)
- Machine1 (type: MachiningEquipment, hasSurfaceRoughness: 0.5, hasMaterialType: Aluminum)
- Machine2 (type: MachiningEquipment, hasSurfaceRoughness: 1.0, hasMaterialType: Steel)

## Using the Ontology

1. Modeling Supply Chains: Identify entities and create instances in the ontology.
2. Linking Suppliers and Manufacturers: Associate suppliers with relevant manufacturers.
3. Managing Logistics: Define logistics providers and link them to manufacturers and customers.
4. Tracking Orders: Record orders and link them to customers, products, and processes.
5. Maintaining Inventory: Monitor inventory levels and link them to products and processes.
6. Optimizing Processes: Analyze processes and their relationships with orders, inventory, and logistics.

## Conclusion

This Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO) provides a comprehensive framework to model and manage supply chains systematically. It aids in understanding the relationships between various supply chain components, ensuring a holistic approach to supply chain management.
